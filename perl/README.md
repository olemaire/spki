# SPKI - the Perl flavor

Here is the [Perl] source code for **SPKI**. You still need [OpenSSL]
to make it run, and you could need to install additionnal [Perl] packages, depending on your Operating System distribution (see Installation for more infos).

Note that this [Perl] flavor will only be completed (operational) when the Bash flavor will be completed... so, for now, the [Perl] flavor is still under work.
